# therapy-bot

## Inspiration
Our inspiration was the automation of healthcare services, specifically mental health services to make them more accessible to the general public.
## What it does
Therapy bot asks you how you are, and conducts a mental health assessment based on natural language processing. It then makes suggestions to the user on steps they can take to improve their situation.
## How we built it
We built the frontend interface using HTML and CSS. The ML algorithm was written in Python using a data set from TensorFlow.
## Challenges we ran into
Maintaining a simple, decluttered chat bot interface without missing any key features. This was resolved by prioritizing certain elements. Incorporating a natural language processing model that analyzes the user's emotions based on the how they describe their feelings.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Training the model and building a prototype of both the interface and algorithm that responds to user input.
## What we learned
We learned how to create a machine learning model by using training and testing data sets from TensorFlow. We also learned how to create a chat bot user interface using frontend technologies.
## What's next for Therapy Bot
Our next steps would be to implement the machine learning model within the chatbot. As well as, to conduct mental health assessments and connect users to beneficial services and resources.
